Backend Task: Simulating an API with Promises
Create a Node.js function that simulates an API using Promises. The function should:
- Randomly resolve or reject the promise.
- Take a random amount of time (between 1 to 5 seconds) to complete.
- Log a success message if resolved or an error message if rejected.
No third-party libraries should be used. Provide an example of how to call this function.
